# About
See how easy it is to use proper translation toolkit in your JavaScript application. 

Stop relying on well meant but ultimately horribly harmful solutions such as requirejs/i18n, jquery.18n, etc...

Start using a proper translation toolkit that will cost nothing today, but will solve you months and years of work down the road.

You can use this project as a template for your JavaScript application or as an example of implementation.

# Install
    $ git clone git@github.com:JanezStupar/js-gettext-primer.git
    $ sudo npm install
    $ bower install
    $ grunt dev
    
# Coming soon(tm)
* Discussion on commonly used translation mechanisms.
* An overview of the Gettext workflow.
* Examples on how to translate with Gettext correctly.

If you like this project and would like something else it doesn't offer yet, go ahead and let me know
